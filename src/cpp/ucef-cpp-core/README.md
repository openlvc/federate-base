# Overview
This is the `core` module of the UCEF federate

This module contains the "core" CPP classes which all other modules depend. There are no executable classes in this module and all classes are intended to be used for the purpose of simplifying the development of HLA federates,  and their associated interactions and object attribute reflections.
