# Overview  
This is the `core` module of the OmnetFederate  
  
This module contains the "core" CPP classes that required to create an OmnetFederate module that can be added into a network topology using OMNeT++ NED. There are no executable classes in this module and check the `OmnetFederateTest` example in `ucef-cpp-examples` for usage of this.
