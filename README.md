#UCEF
UCEF is an open-source tool kit that provides a collaborative
experiment-development environment.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and its partner, the
Institute for Software Integrated Systems at Vanderbilt University, have
developed a collaborative experiment development environment across
heterogeneous architectures integrating best-of-breed tools including
programming languages, communications co-simulation, simulation platforms,
hardware in the loop, and others.

This environment combines these simulators and emulators from many researchers
and companies with a standardized communications protocol, IEEE Standard 1516
High Level Architecture (HLA).
